This baseline scope and sequence of the curriculum is based on the following:

  - A 9am-5pm day with a lunch break from 1-2pm:

    - 9-10am represents a one hour session typically occupied by an exercise, introduction, reflection, and sometimes, a short lesson
    - 10am-1pm and 2-5pm are dedicated to lessons, labs, and outcomes sessions
