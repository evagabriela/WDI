# WDI's Unit 1 Curriculum

Our curriculum contains objectives, prerequisites, suggested materials, starter and solution code, and other instructional resources, tying into the overall standards for each unit. See below for a complete description of all the lesson planning material we provide. Use this folder to reference our baseline resources for Unit 1. Anyone is welcome to submit new lessons in the appropriate folders, or suggest changes to existing ones.

> Instructors should review our [onboarding instructions](../resources/onboarding/instructor-onboarding) and read up on our [feedback guidelines](../projects/project-feedback.md) for debriefing student assignments.

## Navigating Unit 1 Course Materials

Tips for browsing the links below:

- The resources are linked to their location: clicking the link will take you to the lesson/lab readme, any starter/solution code, and tests.
- **#** - Resource links with a "#" are time blocks dedicated for outcomes lessons. Coordinate with your local outcomes teams to fill these slots.
- **@** - Resource links with a "@" are resources from other courses that need to be adapted for COURSE-ACRONYM or resources that only contain learning objectives. We'd love for you to contribute a resource with a pull request.
- ***** - Resource links with a "*" are resources that are currently being worked on


This baseline scope and sequence of the curriculum is based on the following:

  - A 9am-5pm day with a lunch break from 1-2pm:

    - 9-10am represents a one hour session typically occupied by an exercise, introduction, reflection, and sometimes, a short lesson
    - 10am-1pm and 2-5pm are dedicated to lessons, labs, and outcomes sessions

##### Project 1

Student will be building their very first ______________________.

This project will be split into two phases. First, students will be creating _____________________________________. Then, they will be ________________________________________ as well as describing what happens when ___________________________________. Students will receive instructor feedback after each iteration.  Second, you will be coding the app itself. Students will implement the design they created in the first step using all of the knowledge gained during weeks one and two.

- **Goal**: _______________________________
- **Project Time**: ___ days
- **[Detailed Spec File](../projects/project-01/readme.md)**

## Available Materials

For every lesson, we've supplied a folder full of materials, including the following:

| Materials | Description | How to Use It |
|----|---------|---------------|
| __readme.md__| Topic overview & breakdown | Use this to get a high level view, including information on lesson content, in-class activities, objectives, prework, projects, and student resources.|
| __Starter Code Folder__| Code and tests for demos and questions for guided or independent practice | Use this to walk students through code snippets or give students workshops / lab assignments in-class|
| __Solution Code Folder__| Solutions for guided & independent practice | Use this to assess or walk students through solutions when needed|
| __Datasets__| Dataset used during lesson | Use this during demos/codealongs as well as guided and independent practice activities. |
| __Assets__| Screenshots, pictures or other materials needed for lesson | Use this during demos/codealongs as well as guided and independent practice activities. |

> Instructor's Note: You should share Starter code and Datasets in the student-facing repo and direct students to the relevant file during your lessons. Feel free to share the solution code with them afterward.

### Folder Navigation
Each lesson folder is organized in the following pattern:

- **Lesson**: includes the root lesson readme
  - _Starter Code_: __________________ for demos, as well as questions for guided and independent practice
  - _Solution Code_: _________________ with answers to questions from guided and independent practice
  - _Assets_
    - **Dataset**: Includes or links to the dataset(s) used during demo, guided, and independent practice
    - **Images**: Includes or links to any images referenced
    - **Slides**: Includes and links to the baseline lesson deck for you to modify


## Lesson Structure

Lesson plans are organized as follows:

1. **YAML Frontmatter**: Meta information including the duration of the lesson/lab, the author's name and location, and the most relevant curriculcum standard tied to this lesson
2. **Learning Objectives**: What students should be able to do after lesson completion
3. **Student Prework**: What students should already know how to do before this lesson
4. **Instructor Prep**: Specific instructions for the instructor
5. **Lesson Guide**: High level timing overview of lesson structure
6. **Lesson Content**: Content is divided into modular, adjustable components by topic:
  - _Opening_: Objectives, QA, Reminders
