## Overview
Computational Thinking is a skill that takes a lot of practice to master– but there other ways to exercise it beyond just writing code! Practicing computational thinking will help you develop a strong foundation before you start learning JavaScript. One thing to keep in mind as you try these exercises is that the answer is not obvious– you'll have to 'think outside the box'! You may find creating lists or small sketches will be helpful during these exercises.

## Directions
Pair with a partner to answer the following series of word problems that will help you exercise your Computational Thinking brain!

### Question One
A traveller comes to a fork in the road which leads to two villages. In one village the people always tell lies, and in the other village the people always tell the truth. The traveller needs to conduct business in the village where everyone tells the truth. A man from one of the villages is standing in the middle of the fork, but there is no indication of which village he is from. The traveller approaches the man and asks him one question. From the villager's answer, he knows which road to follow. What did the traveller ask?

```
Which way leads to where you live?
```

### Question Two
A man walks into an art gallery and concentrates on one picture in particular. The museum curator notices this and asks the man why he is so interested in that one painting. The man replies, "Brothers and sisters have I none, but that man's father is my father's son."

Who is in the painting?

```
It's him in the painting!
```

### Question Three
Name four days of the week that start with the letter "t"?

```
Tuesday
Thursday
Today
Tomorrow
```

### Question Four
A man has to get a fox, a chicken, and a sack of corn across a river. He has a row boat, and it can only carry him and one other thing. If the fox and the chicken are left together, the fox will eat the chicken. If the chicken and the corn are left together, the chicken will eat the corn. How does the man do it?

```
Carry chicken
Carry fox, grab chicken on return
Carry corn, leave chicken
Carry chicken
```
