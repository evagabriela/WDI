##Learning Objectives
- Use flexbox to set up a grid system

## Exercise
<!-- SME NEEDED: This exercise should be to create a simple, responsive site. 
Provide them with the HTML and CSS (where the layout is built with floats) and have them convert to flexbox & add media queries. -->

Pretend you've been hired as a junior developer to update a site with an old layout built with floats. The HTML can stay exactly the same, but the CSS must be changed to meet the requirements below. Be sure to reference the mockups in the Deliverables section for guidance.

#### Requirements

- Change the layout from float to flex
- Remove any unnecessary CSS without jeopardizing the layout 
- Add media queries to adjust the layout for smaller screens as per images below
- Fix any errors (formatting or otherwise) in the CSS

#### Starter code
<!-- SME NEEDED: We should provide HTML (ideally that they will not change) and CSS where the layout is built with floatsâ€“ and maybe contains additional errors? -->

#### Deliverables
Here are the mockups you should reference while building your site.
<!-- SME NEEDED: add mockups of 3 different screen sizes / layouts -->
