## Learning Objectives
- Style a form with inputs and buttons using CSS
- Understand and apply attribute selectors

## Introduction
Using what you've learned about building and styling forms, you can now practice on your own!

## Exercise
Take 10 minutes to review the deliverable(s) below and discuss your approach for building the form with a partner. Be sure to consider CSS during your discussion. After you plan the build and design, work independently to complete the requirements.

**BONUS** If you finish early, continue working to make the form responsive.

#### Requirements
On your own:
- Write HTML for the form
  - You will need to look up the `textarea` element
  - Optional: Look up `fieldset` element
- Style the form with CSS. Focus on getting the form centered and getting the information on the right rows, and then add other styles if you have time.

> Instructor note: Solution code [here](solution-code) does not include responsive CSS.
