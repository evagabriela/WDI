##Learning Objectives
- Style a form with inputs and buttons using CSS
- Understand and apply attribute selectors

## Introduction

<!-- SME NEEDED: Create a 90-minute lab.
Option 1) Have the student work from a mockup to create a new form
Option 2) Give the student starter-code with errors and have them work to correct those errors. You may also include a form that's not responsive so they can add media queries.

Their current exercise is outdated design-wise: https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/cat_fancy

Keep in mind the students haven't learned JavaScript yet, so while this exercise can introduce some JS concepts, it should not require them to use JS. It might be interesting to add a bonus question that challenges them to look up JS and experiment. -->
