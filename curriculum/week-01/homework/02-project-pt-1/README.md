#### Overview

Congratulations! You have been hired as the developer for Monument Lifestyle Magazine. You are working closely with a designer and have been provided design mockups for the website. Your goal is to replicate these mockups as closely as possible.

You will be adding components to the blog page for homework each night this week and will be working on building the landing page for the site over the weekend.


---

#### Requirements

Your work must:


- Use a unique title and a single unique h1 tag
- Show images using img tags including unique alt attributes
- Use an external CSS stylesheet to style your pages
- Your HTML file should be properly structured, including a head and body.
- Use HTML5 structural elements (nav, header, footer)
- Follow naming conventions, maintain consistency across your .html and .css files
- Indent nested elements to increase your code's readability
- Use IDs, classes, and nested selectors to to select and style elements on the page
readable.
- Use [HTML](https://html5.validator.nu/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) validators to check for errors before submitting.


**Bonus:**

- Google and implement a background-image for the header section. You will want to look up properties such as background-image, background-size, and background-position.
- Google and implement FontAwesome Icons for the footer links to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
- Look up Emmet shortcuts for how to quickly scale up your HTML.
- Experiment with padding and margin to add space between elements on the page.

#### Starter code

Images that you'll need to recreate the blog have been provided in the Starter Code folder. This folder contains images that you will use today as well as images that you will use when you build the landing page.

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- First you'll want to create a blog.html file for the blog (you'll be using index.html for the landing page you'll build over the weekend)
- Next create a CSS file for the project (be sure to use the .css file extension).
- Add a link to the CSS file in the head of your HTML file.
- Start by writing the HTML for the assignment and focusing on the _structure_ of the page (~ 20 minutes)
- Look at the design and start with the most general styles. For example, what color is most of the text? Does most of the text appear to use the same font-family? (~10 minutes)
- Then begin adding more specific styles for elements. (~ 15 min)

Be sure to pay attention to detail and consider the following:
- Did you consider the relationship of h-tags size to one another?
- Is the design of your h-tags consistent?
- Did you use a similar font-family to the design?
-Does your nav stand out against other links but still feel consistent with the page design?
- Do you have anything *unstyled* or using its initial style on the page? (Blue, underlined links, Times New Roman font, etc.)
