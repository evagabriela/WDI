## Intro to Arrays (15 mins)

Arrays — what are they, and what are they good for?

Watch this [intro video](https://generalassembly.wistia.com/medias/upd8qxyabg) to find out!

As you learned in the intro video, variables cannot hold multiple values, so we use arrays when we want to use more than one value at once.

Unfortunately, strings and numbers are not enough for most programming purposes.
What is needed are collections of data that we can use efficiently -- Arrays.

Take a look at this [video](https://generalassembly.wistia.com/medias/uey023vfx6) that provides an overview of how we can work with arrays.

Said another way, an array is an ordered list of items — also known as elements — separated by commas and situated between brackets [ ].

![](assets/array_syntax.svg)

Arrays are data structures, similar in concept to lists. For example:

``` js
var animals = ["cat", "dog", "cow", "chicken"];
var age = [24, 11, 55];
```

They usually contain the same kind of data, and, in JavaScript, they can dynamically grow and shrink in size.

Arrays can also contain different types of data, such as:

``` js
var stuff = ["red", 42, "gorilla", false];
```

However, we generally use arrays to deal with elements of the same data type.


Arrays help us make the most out of our elements, allowing us to:

- Reorder elements.
- Identify the value of one element in the list by specifying its position.
- Go through the list item-by-item and manipulate each element.

#### Working with Arrays

Before we dive deeper into arrays, let’s learn a little about indexes.

Items in an array are stored in sequential order. Each element has an index, a number that tells us the position in the array where the element can be found.

Indexes allow you to access and update array values.

Take a look at this grocery list. Do you notice anything interesting about how these items are numbered?


<img src="assets/grocery_list.svg" width="200">

You may have noted that the numbers start at 0 instead of 1.

JavaScript, like many programming languages, is zero-based, meaning that its numbering starts at 0 instead of 1.

So, when we start assigning index values to an array, the first position in the array will be [0], the second will be [1], and so on.

![](assets/students.png)


#### Recap
Let’s review everything we know about arrays so far:

We typically create an array using a list with the same type of values. Here, we are using strings only.

![](assets/heroes.png)

We declare arrays the same way we declare variables.

![](assets/declare.png)

Each item is called an element. They are separated by commas and situated between square brackets.

![](assets/elements.png)

The index is the number that tells us the position of an element in an array. It always starts with the number 0.

Our friend Batman from Lesson 2 can be found at index 1

![](assets/indexes.png)

> Exercise: Open the console in Chrome and do the following:
1. Declare a variable called villains and assign it an array with the following strings: Cruella, Ursula, Jafar, Captain Hook.
2. Don't forget single or double quotation marks around your strings and a semicolon at the end of your array.
3. Now type villains and press enter.

Does your array look like this?

![](assets/answer1.png)

Now, which villain is in index 3?

![](assets/q2.png)

Because the index starts at 0, index 3 is Captain


> Note: an alternate way to declare arrays is by using the JS keyword `new`
```javascript
var a = new Array();
=> undefined
```


***
## Accessing and updating elements in an array (15 mins)
#### Getting data from an array

To access, or retrieve, a value from an array, we will use the array name, followed by an index number, wrapped in square brackets.

Let’s take a look at some examples.

![](assets/villains.png)

The first code is accessing index 0, so it should return “Cruella.”

The second code is accessing index 3, so it should return “Captain Hook.”


Bonus: Can you come up with a way of asking for a random index (whole number) between zero and the length of your array? HINT: Math.random and Math.floor

#### Adding a new value to an array

To add a new value to the array, specify the index number of the position where the new value should be added.

![](assets/JSC_U1L4_villian_array3.png)

We should now have a new list (Cruella is replaced with Scar):

![](assets/JSC_U1L4_villian_array4.png)



<!--
ID NEEDED: Can you format the following exercise?
Create an array of villains again, with the same list of villains (Cruella, Ursula, Jafar, Captain Hook).
Now replace Cruella with Scar, using the correct index number (remember indexes start at 0 in JS).
Note: the console returns 'Scar' because that is the newest value that was added to the array.
Add an additional villain 'Maleficent' at the end of the array using the correct index number.
Note: the console returns the newest value that was added.

Now, type villains and press enter. Does your console look like this?

![](assets/a3.png)

-->

***
## Array Deep Dive (20 mins)

#### Length method

Now, let’s look at length property. All arrays have a property called length, which tells you how many elements the array contains.

To access this value, simply tack on .length to the end of an array (or, alternatively, a variable containing that array). Here are some examples of .length in action:

``` js
['a', 'b', 'c'].length;  // Evaluates to 3

var x = [10, 20, 30, 40];
x.length; // Evaluates to 4
```


One helpful part of knowing the length of an array is that it allows us to easily find the last (or second-to-last, or third-to-last, etc.) element.

Because the first element in an array always has an index of 0, the index of the last element will be equal to the length of the array minus one.

``` js
var team = ['ted', 'lem', 'phil', 'linda', 'veronica'];
team[team.length - 1];   // Evaluates to 'veronica'.
team[team.length - 2];   // Evaluates to 'linda'.
```

<!--
ID NEEDED: Can you format the following exercise?

Declare a variable called `villains` again and assign it an array with the same list of strings as before (Cruella, Ursula, Jafar, Captain Hook)
Now use the length property to find out how many items are in your `villains` array.
Note: We use `villains.length`;
Did your console return the value 4? (We listed four villains in total, therefore our array length is 4).
-->

#### Array helper methods


In addition to containing multiple elements, arrays also have a number of other built-in properties and functions that give them useful abilities. These are called array helper methods.

Let’s take a look at some of them:

- .push()
- .pop()
- .reverse()
- .join()


***.push()***
The .push() method allows you to add one or more items to the end of an array.

Note that this means the length of that array will also change.


<!--

ID NEEDED: Can you format the following exercise?

Create an empty array of foods: var favoriteFoods = [];.
Use the .push() method to add the item "cheese": favoriteFoods.push('cheese');.
Note: the console returns 1 because that's the number of items you added to the array.
Now add multiple new items at once: favoriteFoods.push('pizza', 'rice', 'taco');.
Type favoriteFoods and enter to see your final array. Does your array look like this?

```js

[ 'cheese', 'pizza', 'rice', 'taco’ ]
```

-->

***.pop()***

The .pop() method is useful when you want to remove the last item in an array.
favoriteFoods.pop();

Using this method the array will now contain this:

```js
[ 'cheese', 'pizza', 'rice' ]
```

What do you think will happen when you call .pop() on an empty array?

***.reverse()***

You can reverse the order of elements in an array with the .reverse() method.

```js
favoriteFoods.reverse()
=> [ 'rice', 'pizza', 'cheese']
```

***.join()***

The .join() method joins all elements of an array into a single string.
The .join() method accepts an optional argument (the separator), which becomes a string that separates the array values.

Here is how we would add .join() in order to turn commas into spaces instead:

```js
favoriteFoods.join(' ')
=> 'rice pizza cheese'
```

If no argument is supplied to .join(), the separator defaults to a comma.

```js

favoriteFoods.join()
=> 'rice,pizza,cheese'
```


Remember, though, you'll never remember _every_ method.  Explore the the [full documentation for array methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) and other helper methods given to you for particular objects.

Video: Looping Conditionals

In the past few lessons we’ve only been able to operate on one value at a time. For example:

`If` a bank has more than $20, allow a withdrawal. `Else` show an error message.

In this lesson, we’re going to learn about collections and loops and why they’re useful.


**Collections** are groups of values. An example of a collection is an array. One of the most useful things about collections (and arrays in particular) is that if we structure our code correctly, we can repeat the same operation on each value within a collection.


This process of doing something over and over and over again in a loop, for each element in a set, is called **iteration**. while (someCondition) { //A block of code. }


To tell your program to repeat something, you use a tool called a **loop**. Loops work just like you might imagine: Once your program has finished running a block of code, it 'loops' back to the beginning and starts again.

Remember our `if` statement from the previous lesson? Let's loop it back on itself.


![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4819/Slide-14-Flow-Chart.svg)



All we have to do is make one small (but very important) change: instead of advancing to the next bit of code after executing the block, we loop back to our condition.


![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4820/Slide-6-Flow-Chart.svg)




Now, we have a loop — so long as our condition remains true (or at least truthy), we will continue to run that block of code over and over again. This type of loop is called a **while loop**, and it can be found in nearly every programming language.


The general rule for writing a **while loop** in JavaScript is: while (someCondition) { // A block of code. } As you can see, it's written in almost exactly the same way as an `if` statement.

Let’s look at an example. If x = 10 and we're subtracting 2 each time we go through the loop, how many times will this loop run?


![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4931/Slide-8a-Loop.svg)



If you guessed 3 times, you're right! The final value of x will be 4. Remember, you can use `console.log(x)` to find this answer in the console.


![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/5137/Slide-11-Loop-3-Times.svg)




Let’s look at another example: var x = 10; var y = 1; while (x < 20) { y += 1; } How many times will this loop run?


var x = 10; var y = 1; while (x < 20) { y += 1; }

The loop would run indefinitely. Since x is defined as 10 and x is less than 20, the computer will run it forever because it is always true.


var x = 10; var y = 1; while (x < 20) { y += 1; }

A `while` loop can run **indefinitely** as long as your condition remains true or until a condition is met.


var x = 10; var y = 1; while (x < 20) { y += 1; }

The advantage is the computer will run code until a condition is met; the disadvantage is that you have no idea how long that will take (_and it will most likely cause your computer to freeze!_).


var x = 10; var y = 1; while (x < 20) { y += 1; }

When using a `while` loop, it's **very important** to plan out beforehand how you will 'escape' the loop by making your condition evaluate to false.

Take a look at the following example: ![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4933/Slide-11-myString-Example.svg)
Questions to consider: * How many times does this loop run? * What's the final value of myString?

![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4934/Slide-12-myString-Annotated.svg)
Each time this loop runs, the value of z increases by 1. Since its initial value is 0, and the condition becomes false the moment that z becomes 5, our loop will run exactly 5 times.

![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4934/Slide-12-myString-Annotated.svg)
As a result, the string myString has a final value of "XXXXX" (5 Xs).

![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4934/Slide-12-myString-Annotated.svg)
So each time we use z += 1, we increase the value of z so that eventually our condition, z < 5, will be false. If we increase z by one each time, there is no way that z will always be less than 5! This is our **“escape plan”** for this while loop.


Confused? Don’t worry, here's the play-by-play:
## LOOP 1
![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4935/Slide-14-myString-Example.svg)
* `z` starts with the value 0 and `myString` is set to `""`. * Since `z = 0`, the statement `z < 5` is true; so the block gets executed. * In the 4th line, `"X"` gets added to the end of `myString`; it is now `"X"` * In the 5th line, `z` is increased by 1; its value is now 1. * Now that the block is done, we loop back to the condition.
## LOOP 2
![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4937/Slide-16-X-Added.svg)
* Now `z` has the value 1; however z < 5 is still true; so the block still gets executed. * In the 4th line, `"X"` gets added to the end of `myString`; it is now `"XX"` * In the 5th line, `z` is increased by 1; its value is now 2. * Now that the block is done, we loop back to the condition once again.
## LOOP 3
![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4938/Slide-17-Z-Increased.svg)
* Now `z` has the value 2, so once again `z < 5` is true and the block gets executed. * In the 4th line, `"X"` gets added to the end of `myString`; it is now `"XXX"` * In the 5th line, `z` is increased by 1; its value is now 3. * Now that the block is done, we go back to the condition.

![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4934/Slide-12-myString-Annotated.svg)
This continues until `z` has the value 5. Once `z` is 5, `z < 5` will become **false**; and therefore, the block will not get executed again.

![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4934/Slide-12-myString-Annotated.svg)
What's most interesting about this kind of setup is that if we changed that condition from `z < 5` to `z < 10`, or `z < 100`, the loop would change to run exactly 10 or exactly 100 times, respectively.

![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4934/Slide-12-myString-Annotated.svg)
Basically, we’ve changed the `while` loop so that it always runs for a fixed, controllable number of times—ensuring that it will never get stuck in an infinite loop.

![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4934/Slide-12-myString-Annotated.svg)
This kind of setup is so useful, and gets used so frequently, that most languages include a special kind of loop used for just this kind of behavior, called a `for` loop.


Despite being one of the most basic ways to iterate through an array in JavaScript (and many other languages), the `for` loop is also one of the most versatile ones!

Let's make a few modifications to our `while` loop from earlier. As you can see, there are a couple of key ingredients to making our `for` loop work.


![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4365/Slide-27-Flow-Chart.svg)



Let’s break down what we’ll need: 1\. An 'initialization', which sets up a starting situation (e.g. var i = 0) 2\. A condition, which gets evaluated each time we're about to execute the block (e.g. i < 10) 3\. A 'finalExpression', which gets evaluated immediately after the block executes _but before the condition is evaluated again_ (e.g. i += 1;)


![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4365/Slide-27-Flow-Chart.svg)




The general syntax for a `for` loop is: for (initialization; condition; finalExpression) { // A block of code. }

## Let’s practice! Look at the code below: var x = 10; for (var i = 0; i < x; i += 1) { console.log('HELLO'); } Use the console below to answer the questions.
1\. How many times will `HELLO` be printed out in the console? * `Hello` will be printed out 10 times. 3\. What if we changed the starting value of i to 1 instead of 0? How many times would `HELLO` get printed to the console then? * `Hello` will be printed out 9 times. 5\. What would happen if we changed the condition from `i < x` to `i <= x?` * `Hello` will be printed out 11 times. 7\. What would happen if we changed the final condition from `i += 1` to `i += 2`? * `Hello` will be printed out 5 times. Great job!


Let’s take a step back and recap what we have learned. What is the difference between `for` loops and `while` loops

The `while` loop is usually used when you need to repeat something until a given condition is true: inputInvalid = true; while(inputInvalid) { //ask user for input inputInvalid // check valid input; }
On the other hand, the `for` loop is usually used when you need to iterate a given number of times: for(var i = 0; i < 100; i+=1) { ...//do something for a 100 times. }


You can learn more about the differences between `for` and `while` loops [here](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/244393/what-are-the-differences-between-a-while-loop-and-a-for-loop).

Let’s look at a temperature converter for an example of a `for` loop.


![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4366/Slide-34-Thermometer.svg)



Suppose that we were given an array of starting values to work with—a group of temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit. Now let’s say we want to convert them into another set of values—temperatures in degrees Celsius—which would then be stored in a separate array.
var tempsInF = [100, 72, 88, 15, 25, 32]; var tempsInC = [];


The formula for converting between Fahrenheit and Celsius temperatures is **C = (F - 32) * 5/9**, where F is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and C is the temperature in degrees Celsius.


So how do we go about operating on the elements in tempsInF? Well, we could just start at the beginning and work our way through, one value at a time. tempsInC.push((tempsInF[0] - 32) * (5 / 9));


Then, we could run an almost identical command to operate on each element in tempsInF and push the converted value onto the tempsInC array: tempsInC.push((tempsInF[1] - 32) * (5 / 9)); tempsInC.push((tempsInF[2] - 32) * (5 / 9)); tempsInC.push((tempsInF[3] - 32) * (5 / 9)); tempsInC.push((tempsInF[4] - 32) * (5 / 9)); tempsInC.push((tempsInF[5] - 32) * (5 / 9)); However, this code is extremely repetitious, and it also forces us to "hard code" exactly how many times we want the operation to be performed.


What is "hard coding"? Generally you’ll want to avoid hard coding because it means you’ve set a value as fixed. If you want to go in and change it, you’d have to manually change the code in every single place it appears (which could be a lot of times if you have a long complex program). It is better to let the code input actual values or write code so that if you want to change a value you can change it once and it will change throughout. tempsInC.push((tempsInF[1] - 32) * (5 / 9)); tempsInC.push((tempsInF[2] - 32) * (5 / 9)); tempsInC.push((tempsInF[3] - 32) * (5 / 9)); tempsInC.push((tempsInF[4] - 32) * (5 / 9)); tempsInC.push((tempsInF[5] - 32) * (5 / 9));


Let’s return to our temperature example. You wouldn’t want to hard code the temperature to be 72 degrees, as temperature constantly changes. What if the temperature was 60? You would have to go through and manually change each value to 60. Rather you’d want to create code that can take whatever the current temperature is and perform an operation.


It'd be better if there were a way to run this code exactly as many times as there are elements in the first array. Fortunately, there is a tool perfectly suited for this task—our old friend, the `for` loop. for (var i = 0; i < tempsInF.length; i += 1) { tempsInC.push((tempsInF[i] - 32) * (5 / 9)); }



For Loop

for (var i = 0; i < tempsInF.length; i += 1) { tempsInC.push((tempsInF[i] - 32) * (5 / 9)); }


Operating One Element At a Time

tempsInC.push((tempsInF[1] - 32) * (5 / 9)); tempsInC.push((tempsInF[2] - 32) * (5 / 9)); tempsInC.push((tempsInF[3] - 32) * (5 / 9)); tempsInC.push((tempsInF[4] - 32) * (5 / 9)); tempsInC.push((tempsInF[5] - 32) * (5 / 9));

Take a minute to think about what's going on above. By starting our count at zero `var i = 0`, increasing `i` by one every time, and stopping before `i` reaches the length of the array `i < tempsInF.length`, we are running the loop one time for every item in the array.



For Loop

for (var i = 0; i < tempsInF.length; i += 1) { tempsInC.push((tempsInF[i] - 32) * (5 / 9)); }


Operating One Element At a Time

tempsInC.push((tempsInF[1] - 32) * (5 / 9)); tempsInC.push((tempsInF[2] - 32) * (5 / 9)); tempsInC.push((tempsInF[3] - 32) * (5 / 9)); tempsInC.push((tempsInF[4] - 32) * (5 / 9)); tempsInC.push((tempsInF[5] - 32) * (5 / 9));

`i` will be successively set to the index of every element in our array, allowing us to perform the same operation on each element.


So, in other words, we are looping through each item in the tempsInF array, converting that value to celsius, and then adding the celsius value to the end of the tempsInC array. We could just as easily have gone in the opposite direction—starting at the last element, and ending with the first—simply by specifying different settings in the `for` loop: for (var i = (tempsInF.length - 1); i >= 0; i -= 1) { tempsInC.push((tempsInF[i] - 32) * (5 / 9)); }


We could even operate only on every third element, by changing the value we increment `i` with, like so `i += 3`: for (var i = 2; i < tempsInF.length; i += 3) { tempsInC.push(fahrToCelc(tempsInF[i])); }


We’ve seen how loops can be used to easily repeat a certain set of actions numerous times. You will learn throughout this course how you can utilize loops in order to make your work more efficient and simpler.


<!-- U2L4 -->

Now that you’re feeling more comfortable with if...else statements, let's go back to the other type of conditional statement we mentioned earlier in this unit: **switch statements**. We've seen how a person can check numerous conditions by simply tacking on **else if statements**.

if (x > 10) {
x += 10;
y += 10;
} else if (x > 5) {
x += 5;
} else if (x > 3) {
x += 3;
}

Here’s a refresher of what the flowchart for this action would look like: ![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4408/Slide-4-Flow-Chart.svg)

However, if we have a lot of conditions, the code becomes repetitive and hard to read. For example:



// day of the week in a number, sunday is 0, saturday is 6
var dayNumber = 1;
if(dayNumber === 0){
day = 'Sunday';
} else if(dayNumber === 1) {
day = 'Monday';
} else if(dayNumber === 2) {
day = 'Tuesday';
} else if(dayNumber === 3) {
day = 'Wednesday';
} else if(dayNumber === 4) {
day = 'Thursday';
} else if(dayNumber === 5) {
day = 'Friday';
} else if(dayNumber === 6) {
day = 'Saturday';
} else {
day = null;
alert('wrong value for day');
}

// day of the week in a number, sunday is 0, saturday is 6
var dayNumber = 1;
if(dayNumber === 0){
day = 'Sunday';
} else if(dayNumber === 1) {
day = 'Monday';
} else if(dayNumber === 2) {
day = 'Tuesday';
} else if(dayNumber === 3) {
day = 'Wednesday';
} else if(dayNumber === 4) {
day = 'Thursday';
} else if(dayNumber === 5) {
day = 'Friday';
} else if(dayNumber === 6) {
day = 'Saturday';
} else {
day = null;
alert('wrong value for day');
}


What the code to the left does, fundamentally, is pretty simple — it takes in a number (representing a particular day of the week) and spits out a string containing the name of that day. However, this code is not easy to read, and a lot of it is repeated. For one, `} else if(dayNumber === __ ) {` is repeated seven times. What's more, if we ever want to change the name of our `dayNumber` variable, we'll need to swap it out every place it appears.

Enter the `switch statement`. A **switch statement** is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. It is a replacement for if/else statements when our code gets long and nested. Take a look at how the previous example would be written as a switch statement:



var dayNumber = 1;
switch (dayNumber) {
case 0:
  day = 'Sunday';
  break;
case 1:
  day = 'Monday';
  break;
case 2:
  day = 'Tuesday';
  break;
case 3:
  day = 'Wednesday';
  break;
case 4:
  day = 'Thursday';
  break;
case 5:
  day = 'Friday';
  break;
case 6:
  day = 'Saturday';
  break;
default:
  day = null;
  alert('wrong value for day');
}

This code works exactly the same as our `if/else` statement, and, even though it contains more lines, it's significantly easier to read. In a switch statement, the variable in parentheses (in this case, `dayNumber`) is evaluated; if there is a `case` listed for the value it evaluates to, the code between `case __:` and `break` will be executed. If there is no `case` that matches the value of the variable, the `default` will be executed (if it is specified, that is — if not, the program will do nothing).

![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4409/Slide-9-Code.svg)



If there is no `break;` at the end of a case, the computer will not skip to the end. Instead, it will start executing the next case's code (even if the case's value is different than the variable’s), and will continue doing so until it eventually hits a `break;` statement.

![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/5014/Slide-10-Break.svg)



For this reason, default never needs a `break;` statement, as it's the last case in the switch. Include breaks on all other statements to makes sure the program breaks out of switch once it executes the matched statement.  


![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/5014/Slide-10-Break.svg) The main advantages of switch statements is the increase in readability and the decrease in repetition, both of which make your code more maintainable. Although the switch statement has some advantages over `if...else`, it also has some major disadvantages. For instance, a switch statement will only work if you are testing the same variable (or expression) in every condition; if not, the `if...else` is your only option. Also, depending on the circumstances, using `if...else` might scan more naturally. As a rule, use switch statements when you are working with only one variable, or if you have three or more conditions to check.

![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4411/Slide-12-Chart.svg) Use `if...else` when you have multiple variables (or expressions) or only need one `else...if` statement.

![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4411/Slide-12-Chart.svg)  

Now it’s time to test yourself. Take a look at the following `switch` statement:

switch (2 * x) {
case 2:
  y = 49;
  break;
case 4:
  y = 37;
  break;
case 6:
  y = 25;
  break;
case 8:
  y = 13;
  break;
default:
  y = 1;
}



What value will `y` be assigned when `x` is ...

*   1?
*   4?
*   0?
*   "Hello"?

You can do mental math first, or use the console below to check your answers:

Pause and come up with your answers before clicking forward. Let’s take a look at the answers.

switch (2 * x) {
case 2:
  y = 49;
  break;
case 4:
  y = 37;
  break;
case 6:
  y = 25;
  break;
case 8:
  y = 13;
  break;
default:
  y = 1;
}



What value will `y` be assigned when `x` is ...

*   1 ?
*   Answer: 49
*   4?
*   Answer: 13
*   0 ?
*   Answer: 1
*   "Hello"?
*   Answer: 1

Great job! Now that we’ve had a chance to gain some experience with switch statements, let’s move on. Another shortcut for a simple JavaScript if...else statement is the **ternary statement**. A ternary statement is a one-line shorthand for an if...else statement. Similar to an `if...else` statement, it evaluates a condition and then returns one of two results based on whether the condition is true or false. Take a look at the following `if...else` statement:

var studentPasses;
if (score > 80) {
studentPasses = true;
} else {
studentPasses = false;
}



![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4407/Slide-16-Exam.svg) The code from the last slide could be shortened to a single line using a ternary statement.  

Let's take a look on the next slide.



var score = 90;
var studentPasses = score > 80 ? true : false;
studentPasses;
//=> true

`condition ? result1 : result2;`

Whatever the `if` condition is will be used as the condition here. Again, a condition is a statement that evaluates to true or false.  


var score = 90;
var studentPasses = score > 80 ? true : false;
studentPasses;
//=> true

`condition ? result1 : result2;`

So, in the example, the condition would be `score > 80`. The condition is then followed by a question mark (`?`).  


var score = 90;
var studentPasses = score > 80 ? true : false;
studentPasses;
//=> true

`condition ? result1 : result2;`

`result1` and `result2` are our possible outcomes. If the condition is true, the operator will return the value of `result1`, otherwise it will return the value of `result2`.



Let’s look at the difference between the two code blocks below. Do you notice the difference in syntax between the `if...else` statement and ternary operators?



var score = 90;
var studentPasses;
if (score > 80) {
studentPasses = true;
} else {
studentPasses = false;
}
//studentPasses would evaluate to true


var score = 90;
var studentPasses = score > 80 ? true : false;
//studentPasses would evalute to true


Here's a second example:

var weather;
if (temperature > 60) {
weather = "fair";
} else {
weather = "poor";
}



This could be shortened to the following:

var weather = temperature > 60 ? "fair" : "poor";



![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4412/Slide-18-Weather.svg)



Although having clean and succinct code is useful, readability is also important. Sometimes ternary statements can be harder to scan and understand than a simple `if...else` statement. So, if you’re ever in doubt, remember to choose readability over less code. Let’s give it a try! Take this `if...else` statement, and turn it into a ternary statement:

var day = "Monday";
var goToWork;
if (day === "Saturday" || day === "Sunday") {
goToWork = false;
} else {
goToWork = true;
}



Try practicing in the console below. Pause and come up with your answer before clicking forward.Does your answer look something like this?

var goToWork = day === "Saturday" || day === "Sunday" ? false : true;

![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4414/Slide-21-Lazy-Sunday.svg)![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4413/Slide-20-Calendar.svg)

# Let's Practice!

What will the value of `goToWork` be under the following circumstances? (Try figuring it out in your head or type the code out in the console.

1.  `var day = "Wednesday"`

*   The console returns `true`

3.  `var day = "Saturday"`

*   The console returns `false`

5.  `var day = "Friday"`

*   The console returns `true`

Great job!



var goToWork;
if (day === "Saturday" || day === "Sunday") {
goToWork = false;
} else {
goToWork = true;
}

Now that you have some experience with ternary statements, let’s talk a bit more about the use of switch statements. First you'll write out the following scenario as a long if...else statement, and then you'll refactor the if...else statement to be a switch statement in the next step.

# Let's Practice!

First, declare a variable grade and set it equal to "B". Then, create an `if...else` statement that checks to see if the student got an A, B, C, D, or F.

*   If the student received an A, log "Awesome Job" to the console.
*   If student received a B, log "Pretty Great" to the console.
*   If student received a C, log "Pretty Average" to the console.
*   If student received a D, log "Need to Study" to the console.
*   If the student received an F, log "Bad Job" to the console.

Here's what the scenario would look like as an if...else statement:



var grade = "B";

if (grade === "A") {
console.log("Awesome Job");
} else if (grade === "B") {
console.log("Pretty Great");
} else if (grade === "C") {
console.log("Pretty Average");
} else if (grade === "D") {
console.log("Need to Study");
} else if (grade === "F") {
console.log("Bad Job");
}


Now, rewrite the if...else statement as a switch statement.  

Here's what this if...else statement will look like when refactored into a switch statement:

var grade = "B";

switch (grade) {
case "A":
  console.log("Awesome Job");
  break;
case "B":
  console.log("Pretty Great");
  break;
case "C":
  console.log("Pretty Average");
  break;
case "D":
  console.log("Need to Study");
  break;
case "F":
  console.log("Bad Job");
  break;
default:
  console.log("Nonexistent");
}

Which is faster—the if...else statement or the switch statement?



var grade = "B";

if (grade === "A") {
console.log("Awesome Job");
} else if (grade === "B") {
console.log("Pretty Great");
} else if (grade === "C") {
console.log("Pretty Average");
} else if (grade === "D") {
console.log("Need to Study");
} else if (grade === "F") {
console.log("Bad Job");
}





var grade = "B";

switch (grade) {
case "A":
  console.log("Awesome Job");
  break;
case "B":
  console.log("Pretty Great");
  break;
case "C":
  console.log("Pretty Average");
  break;
case "D":
  console.log("Need to Study");
  break;
case "F":
  console.log("Bad Job");
  break;
default:
  console.log("Nonexistent");
}

Consider how many computations run in each approach. When evaluating for grade `D` using the `if...else` approach, the condition `grade === 'x'` is evaluated four times. What if the `if...else` statement had 10 conditions? 100? How would this impact the speed of the program? In contrast, when using a switch statement, the condition is only evaluated one time. ![](http://circuits-assets.generalassemb.ly/prod/asset/4415/Slide-24-Awesome-Job.svg) As our scripts grow in size and complexity, we want to make sure that each time we work on a piece of code, we think about how we can make that code perform as effectively as possible. Throughout this course, we’ll be covering small ways to improve performance that will have a big impact, especially on projects with much more code. We saw earlier how `break;` plays a major role in switch statements. Again, if there is no `break;` at the end of a case, the computer will not skip to the end. Instead, it will start executing the next case's code (even if the case's value is different from the variable’s) and do so until it hits a `break;` statement. Can you guess what would happen if you removed the breaks from the switch statement you created? Run the code to find out! In this lesson, we looked at how we can keep our code readable and concise by using ternary and switch statements. We saw how these statements can make our code more concise, more readable, and more effective. Often, developers will write code to get things up and running first and then look back over the code to see how it could be streamlined. Switch and ternary statements are excellent tools for doing just that!
