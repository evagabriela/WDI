## Data Collections

### Arrays

Javascript provides us with a number of native methods that allow us to interact with arrays. Find methods that do each of the following and provide an example...
* Add an element to the back of an array.
* Remove an element from the back of an array.
* Add an element to the front of an array.
* Remove an element from the front of an array.
* Concatenates all the elements in an array into a string.
* Separates the characters of a string into an array.

What will the contents of the below arrays be after the code samples are executed? Come up with an answer yourself before testing it out in the console.
> **HINT:** You might find it helpful to draw the arrays out as you run each line of code.

```js
var numbers = [ 2, 4, 6, 8 ];
numbers.pop();
numbers.push( 10 );
numbers.unshift( 3 );
```
