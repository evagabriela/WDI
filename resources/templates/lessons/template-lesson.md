> #### *Guiding Questions When Using This Template*
>
> - [ ] Are the learning objectives measurable?
>   - [ ] Are there at least two objectives? ( All learning objectives should be pulled from the [Front End Standards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11SzdbIIa9PLJ6kknGXXoBYOtL5ycwMK2N8lkI5THFak/edit#gid=1968474545) doc.  If you would like to add or remove any Learning Objectives, please contact amy.almeida@ga.co)
>   - [ ] Does the lesson address all the learning objectives?
>
> - [ ] Are activities spaced out with enough time for each?
>   - [ ] Did you include knowledge "Checks" or activities at the end of every component to test comprehension?
>   - [ ] Is there an even distribution of intructor-led and active learning portions?
>
>
> - [ ] Did you provide guidance for both students & instructors?
>   - [ ] What will instructors have to do to prepare for this lesson?
>   - [ ] What will students have to do to prepare for this lesson?
>   - [ ] What additional resources do you provide for students who are "hungry for more," or need additional practice?
>
> #### *How to Use This Template*
> * Static Components: Reserve roughly 5 min for Opening, 5 unscheduled "buffer" mins for overrun, & at least 5 min for Conclusion (end of lesson review).
>
>
> * Modular Components: The units of instruction are: Intro, Demo, Guided-Practice, & Independent-Practice. These can be cycled or intermixed in various orders, depending on the topic / content.

> #### *Components of the lesson plan*

> - Opening: this only happens once; used to introduce the agenda, review material, and provide a motivating example / the problem we're trying to solve with this skill/content
> - Introduction: this is a section dedicated to introducing and contextualizing new vocabulary, ideas, and code syntax that will be practiced in later sections
> - Demo: an instructor-led session demonstrating proper techniques or syntax examples
> - Guided Practice: interactive instructor by which the instructor engages with and probes students for answers to guide the discussion or activity
> - Independent Practice: a block of time where students are able to practice what they've learned; the instructor provides directions and the students use the directions to complete an exercise
> - Conclusion: a time to sum up the lesson, review the answers to a final independent practice, and/or pose discussion questions
> - Check: a moment to check to understand students are following; it can be done with a question about content, a general "How comfortable are you with this?", or the instructor can check the output of students code to ensure they've completed the assignment properly.

> NOTE: the lesson you create does not have to follow a progression of Introduction > Demo > Guided Practice > Independent Practice - a combination of these is often ideal - but a lesson must always begin with an Opening and end wth a Conclusion.
