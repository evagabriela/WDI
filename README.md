Welcome to General Assembly's Web Development Unit 1 Course Materials!

This repository/folder contains all the materials General Assembly supplies its producers/instructors and students taking this course.

## Unit 1 Value Proposition

<!--  Taken from the course's confluence -->

Unit 1 is all about showing the humble beginning of the web and getting students comfortable with foundational programming concepts that they will build upon for the rest of the course.  Unit 1 culminates into WDI's Project #1.  By the end of the 3-week unit, students will have the skills to pass GA's Front End Credential (I).  

In this unit, we will cover HTML, CSS and the Github workflow in Week 1, and move into the foundational concepts of Javascript in Week 2.  Week 3 will cover jQuery and give ample time for students to code their first project.

Another goal of this unit is to help students adopt good habits and follow web-development best practices, so that they are able to excel as topics become more complex.
